Rustic Unity Platform
=====================

Rustic Unity Platform is a set of project-agnostic tools that can be used to create video games (or whatever) with the [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) game engine.

## Usage

Clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:rusticgames/rts.git
```

You should now have a fully-functioning project that can be opened and edited with [Unity](http://unity3d.com/).

Store all of your non-platform, i.e., game-specific, assets in `Assets/_Local`. This will allow you to update the platform independently of your game and vice versa.

Voil√†!
